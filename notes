* Add testing for each function

* Give option for user to type 'T/t' if the transaction was today instead of having to type out full formatted date

* Modularize file structure

? Consider implementing SQL/Postgres and JS/Vue for further development and practice

? Get one json file to populate for transactions in each month
    If a new month is entered for a transaction it needs to be added to a file called {month}-{year}-transactions.json
